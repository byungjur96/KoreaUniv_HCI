## HW2

HW2 is to define tree consists of "Primitive" elements and "GUI" objects as an nodes.

Node of each "Primitive" tree and "GUI" tree contains unique id number and children.

By traversing these trees, these graphic elements are visualized bia web browser canvas.

further more, this program can parse XML file so that it can interpret XML file to GUI tree, chich can be rendered onto the canvas.

#### HW 2-1

- Score : `A`
- Implementing a tree data struction of "Primitive" Graphic elements and "GUI" objects.
- Nodes of tree contains id number and arbitrary number of children.
- Basic methods and procedures such as `create_root`, `add_node` , `delete_node` , `search_nodes` should be included.
- Create an example of hierarchy of GUI objects and print their structure recursively.



#### HW 2-2 

- Score: `A`

- Parse a tree of GUI objects and render them using web browser canvas.



#### HW 2-3

- Score: `A+`
- Take a mouse input and identify the object that is clicked by defining the rectangular areal dimension.
- Make a particular routine that can be run when a mouse is clicked.
- `Extra` Extend the program so that an XML or textual description of the GUI tree can be parsed and be rendered onto the canvas.



## HW3

HW3 is to develop a *WebEx* ,  which stands for "Web based Exercise Helper and Diary App".

WebEx is consisted of Setting, Exercise, History Sessions.

In Setting session, we can select exercise routine from fixed set of exercise categories. For each exercise, illustration for exercise is provided. Also, we can choose pacing time and target number of exercise for each exercise.

Exercise session guides exercise during whole training time. This session not only shows time left and exercise type, but also provides voice assistants.

Finally, history session provides daily, weekly, and monthly history.
